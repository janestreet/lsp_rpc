synopsis: "Library for building LSPs in OCaml"
description: "

This library provides an implementation of the RPC layer for language servers to enable
writing language servers in OCaml. The underlying LSP and JSON RPC libraries come from the
OCaml-LSP project; this library provides an Async RPC layer on top of them.
